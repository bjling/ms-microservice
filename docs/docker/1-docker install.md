2. Install Docker CE

    You can install Docker CE in different ways, depending on your needs:

** Most users set up Dockerâ€™s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach.

** Some users download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.

#### Install using the repository

1. SET UP THE REPOSITORY

2. INSTALL DOCKER CE

#### Install from a package

#### Uninstall Docker CE

1. Uninstall the Docker CE package:

~~~
    $ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
